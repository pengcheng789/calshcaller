# Clash Caller

## OverView

Pack a [clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash) library for called on android by java or kotlin.
According to [gomobile wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile), the best Practice for running go program on 
android is writing SDK applications by generating bindings from a Go package.
I use modules in `clash caller` project, Unfortunately, [a bug](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27234) makes 
using gomobile rather difficult. So I won't start this project until the issue is closed.
